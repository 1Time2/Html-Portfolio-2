<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Savyon.</p>

<p>I am a 24-year-old individual who hails from a small town named Quincy, Florida.<br />
  Since my early high school years, I have been actively engaged in the workforce. I have had the opportunity to work as a roofer for three years, in the agricultural sector for one year, and as an electrician for three years. While these experiences have been valuable, they have also revealed my true passion lies in the realm of electronics, particularly phones, cameras, and computers.
</p>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the latest advancements and innovations in the world of technology. From staying updated on the newest phone releases to building my own gaming PC, I have consistently felt a strong desire to delve deeper into this field. This passion led me to explore web development a few years ago, but I had to take a break due to personal circumstances.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, I have resumed my pursuit of web development, and I am thoroughly enjoying the learning process. I am eager to see what the future holds in this exciting field and am committed to expanding my knowledge and skills.
